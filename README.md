# Nearest-neighbor-synthesis-of-CNOT-circuits-on-general-quantum-architectures
The code repository of Nearest neighbor synthesis of CNOT circuits on general quantum architectures

- The main program is `circuits_synthetic_without_HamiltonPath.py](circuits_synthetic_without_HamiltonPath.py`
- The architecture class is defined in `graph.py`. The parent class definition has not been completed yet and the subclass structure needs to be modified manually
